# AccountManager
Just a fun piece of code that I used to teach myself how to work with files in python. 

Views data stored in two files and then adds it to two lists, seperating data by lines. User can check account names and passwords as well as add accounts, remove them and change the passwords while the code is running. Changes to files are made live and stay after the code is quit due to them being stored in files rather than variables.
